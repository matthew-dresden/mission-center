# Mission Center

Monitor your CPU, Memory, Disk, Network and GPU usage with [Mission Center](https://missioncenter.io/)

![](https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0001-cpu.png)

## Features

* Monitor overall or per-thread CPU usage
* See system process, thread, and handle count, uptime, clock speed (base and current), cache sizes
* Monitor RAM and Swap usage
* See a breakdown how the memory is being used by the system
* Monitor Disk utilization and transfer rates
* Monitor network utilization and transfer speeds
* See network interface information such as network card name, connection type (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), wireless speeds
  and
  frequency, hardware address, IP address
* Monitor overall GPU usage, video encoder and decoder usage, memory usage and power consumption, powered by the popular
  NVTOP project
* See a breakdown of resource usage by app and process
* Supports a minified summary view for simple monitoring
* Use hardware accelerated rendering for all the graphs in an effort to reduce CPU and overall resource usage
* Uses GTK4 and Libadwaita
* Written in Rust

## Limitations

Please note there is ongoing work to overcome all of these.

* Per-process network monitoring requires manual setup,
  see [this page](https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/wikis/Home/Nethogs) for more information.
* Intel GPU monitoring is only supported for Broadwell and later GPUs; and does not support VRAM, power, or temperature
  monitoring.
* When using Linux Mint/Cinnamon, launched applications may not show up in the "Applications" section. (Upstream
  issue: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/12015)

Please also note that as Mission Center is a libadwaita application, it will not follow system-defined stylesheets (
themes).

## Building and running

### Building - Native

**Requirements:**

* Meson (version >= 0.63)
* Rust (version >= 1.69)
* CMake
* Protobuf
* Python3
* Python GObject Introspection (required for Blueprint)
* DRM development libraries
* GBM development libraries
* udev development libraries
* GTK 4
* libadwaita

**Build instructions**

Note: A native build requires, at least, GTK 4.18 and libadwaita 1.7. That means ArchLinux >= 20250501, Fedora >= 42,
Ubuntu >= 25.04.

```bash
# On Ubuntu 25.04 all dependencies, except for the Rust toolchain, can be installed with:
sudo apt install build-essential cmake curl desktop-file-utils gettext git libadwaita-1-dev libdbus-1-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libudev-dev meson pkg-config protobuf-compiler python3-gi python3-pip

BUILD_ROOT="$(pwd)/build-meson-debug"

meson setup "$BUILD_ROOT" -Dbuildtype=debug # Alternatively pass `-Dbuildtype=release` for a release build
ninja -C "$BUILD_ROOT"
```

If you want to run the application from the build directory (for development or debugging) some set up is required:

```bash
export PATH="$BUILD_ROOT/subprojects/magpie/src:$PATH"
export GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR="$BUILD_ROOT/data"
export MC_MAGPIE_HW_DB="$BUILD_ROOT/subprojects/magpie/platform-linux/hwdb/hw.db"
export MC_RESOURCE_DIR="$BUILD_ROOT/resources"

glib-compile-schemas --strict "$(pwd)/data" && mv "$(pwd)/data/gschemas.compiled" "$BUILD_ROOT/data/"
```

And then to run the app:

```bash
"$BUILD_ROOT/src/missioncenter"
```

If you want to install the app just run:

```bash
ninja -C $BUILD_ROOT install
```

And run the app from your launcher or from the command-line:

```bash
missioncenter
```

### Building - AppImage

```bash
# On Ubuntu 25.04 all dependencies, except for the Rust toolchain, can be installed with:
sudo apt install build-essential cmake curl desktop-file-utils gettext git libadwaita-1-dev libdbus-1-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libudev-dev meson pkg-config protobuf-compiler python3-gi python3-pip

meson setup _build -Dbuildtype=debug # Alternatively pass `-Dbuildtype=release` for a release build
ninja -C _build
```

And then build the AppImage:

```bash
meson install -C _build --no-rebuild --destdir "AppDir"

appimage-builder --appdir _build/AppDir/ 
```

And run the app from the command-line:

```bash
./"Mission Center-${version}-${arch}.AppImage"
```

### Building - Flatpak

**Requirements:**

* Flatpak
* Flatpak-Builder

Add the `flathub` repo is not already present:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Install the required Flatpak runtimes and SDKs:

```bash
flatpak install -y \
    org.freedesktop.Platform//24.08 \
    org.freedesktop.Sdk//24.08 \
    org.gnome.Platform//48 \
    org.gnome.Sdk//48
```

Finally build a Flatpak package:

```bash
cd flatpak
flatpak-builder --repo=repo --ccache --force-clean build io.missioncenter.MissionCenter.json
flatpak build-bundle repo missioncenter.flatpak io.missioncenter.MissionCenter
```

Install the package:

```bash
flatpak uninstall -y io.missioncenter.MissionCenter
flatpak install -y missioncenter.flatpak
```

Run the app from your launcher or from the command-line:

```bash
flatpak run io.missioncenter.MissionCenter
```
